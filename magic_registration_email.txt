Subject: Data Access Request - GRB190114C for Quantum Gravity Research

Dear MAGIC Collaboration,

I am writing to request access to GRB190114C data for research on quantum gravity phenomenology.

Researcher: Christian Quintino De Luca
Affiliation: RTH Italia (Independent Research)
Email: info@rthitalia.com

Research Objective: 
- Analysis of photon time-of-flight delays
- Search for quantum gravity effects at TeV energies
- Comparison with theoretical predictions

I am particularly interested in:
- Time-tagged event data
- Energy spectra
- Temporal profiles

Please let me know the procedure for data access.

Best regards,
Christian Quintino De Luca
