  "description": "Complete dataset and analysis code for investigating anomalous energy-time correlations in GRB090902B. This package includes all analysis scripts, results, figures, and the complete scientific paper documenting a statistically significant (5.46σ) correlation that is consistent with quantum gravity predictions but requires further investigation to distinguish from astrophysical alternatives.\n\nKey Findings:\n- GRB090902B: 5.46σ energy-time correlation (statistically significant)\n- GRB221009A: No significant effects (0.94σ)\n- 4/5 GRBs show no similar effects (replication failure)\n- Combined analysis of all GRBs: no significant correlation (p=0.73)\n- 60% QG vs 40% astrophysical discrimination (inconclusive)\n- Outlier dependence: removing top 5% reduces significance to 3.26σ\n\nThis work establishes a rigorous methodology for testing quantum gravity predictions in gamma-ray bursts and highlights the need for expanded samples to resolve the origin of this intriguing anomaly.",
