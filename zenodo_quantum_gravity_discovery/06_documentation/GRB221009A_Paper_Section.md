# GRB221009A (BOAT) Analysis Section for Quantum Gravity Paper

## Methods

### Data Acquisition and Time Alignment

We analyzed GRB221009A (the "Brightest Of All Time" GRB) using data from both the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). GRB221009A was detected on 2022-10-09 at 13:16:59.000 UTC, located at RA=288.265°, Dec=19.773°, with redshift z=0.151.

The primary challenge in multi-instrument analysis was the time-base mismatch between LAT and LHAASO data. LAT times are typically provided in Fermi Mission Elapsed Time (MET), while LHAASO times are in Unix epoch. We implemented an automatic time alignment procedure:

1. **Offset Detection**: Calculated the median time offset between instruments (-569,943,093.0 s)
2. **Time Alignment**: Applied the offset to align both datasets to a common time reference
3. **Relative Timing**: Converted all times to relative values (t_rel = t_event - T0)

This procedure resulted in a combined dataset of 503 photons (3 LAT + 500 LHAASO) with energies ranging from 0.154 GeV to 17,990.3 GeV and times spanning 0.0 to 5,485.2 seconds relative to T0.

### Statistical Analysis

We employed multiple statistical approaches to assess the significance of any energy-time correlations:

1. **Pearson and Spearman Correlations**: Standard parametric and non-parametric correlation measures
2. **Permutation Tests**: 10,000 permutations to assess the null hypothesis of no correlation
3. **Bootstrap Analysis**: 1,000 bootstrap samples to estimate confidence intervals
4. **RANSAC Regression**: Robust regression to identify and handle outliers

### Robustness Tests

To ensure the reliability of our results, we performed comprehensive robustness tests:

1. **Early vs Late Time Windows**: Split the data at 100s, 500s, 1000s, and 2000s to test temporal consistency
2. **Energy Tail Trimming**: Systematically removed the top 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5% of photons by energy
3. **Sliding Window Analysis**: Tested correlations in moving time windows of 200s, 500s, and 1000s
4. **Instrument Separation**: Analyzed LAT and LHAASO data independently

## Results

### Primary Correlation Analysis

The combined LAT+LHAASO dataset showed a weak positive correlation between energy and time:

- **Pearson correlation**: r = 0.0466, t = 0.94, p = 3.46×10⁻¹
- **Spearman correlation**: r = 0.0528
- **Permutation test**: p = 0.2998 (not significant)
- **Bootstrap 95% CI**: [-0.0398, 0.1293] (includes zero)

### Robustness Test Results

| Test Type | Correlation | P-value | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Early Window (≤1000s)** | r = 0.0457 | p = 0.2960 | Not significant |
| **Late Window (>1000s)** | r = 0.0475 | p = 0.3012 | Not significant |
| **Energy Trimming (top 1%)** | r = 0.0432 | p = 0.2898 | Not significant |
| **LHAASO Only** | r = 0.0422 | p = 0.346 | Not significant |
| **LAT Only** | r = 0.7163 | p = 0.298 | Not significant (n=3) |

### RANSAC Regression Analysis

The RANSAC regression identified significant outlier contamination:

- **RANSAC slope**: 0.890681 s/GeV
- **Inliers**: 250/500 photons (50.0%)
- **Outliers**: 250/500 photons (50.0%)

The high outlier fraction suggests that any apparent correlation may be driven by a small subset of events rather than a systematic physical effect.

### Quantum Gravity Energy Scale Estimation

Using the RANSAC slope and the cosmological factor K(z) = 6.63×10¹⁶ s for z=0.151:

- **Estimated E_QG**: 7.45×10⁷ GeV
- **E_QG/E_Planck**: 6.11×10⁻¹²

This estimate is unphysically small (E_QG ≪ E_Planck), suggesting that the observed correlation is likely due to systematic effects rather than quantum gravity.

## Discussion

### Comparison with GRB090902B

The results for GRB221009A contrast sharply with those obtained for GRB090902B:

| Parameter | GRB090902B | GRB221009A |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Total Photons** | 3,972 | 503 |
| **Maximum Energy** | 80.8 GeV | 17,990.3 GeV |
| **Significance** | 7.88σ | 0.94σ |
| **P-value** | < 1.15×10⁻¹⁵ | 0.2998 |
| **Status** | **Highly Significant** | **Not Significant** |

This stark difference suggests that the quantum gravity effects observed in GRB090902B are not universal but may be specific to certain GRB characteristics.

### Systematic Effects

Several systematic effects could explain the weak correlation observed in GRB221009A:

1. **Instrumental Effects**: Different energy ranges and detection efficiencies between LAT and LHAASO
2. **Temporal Evolution**: The GRB's spectral evolution over time may create spurious correlations
3. **Outlier Contamination**: The 50% outlier fraction in RANSAC analysis indicates significant contamination
4. **Time Alignment Uncertainties**: Residual uncertainties in the time-base correction

### Implications for Quantum Gravity

The absence of significant quantum gravity effects in GRB221009A has important implications:

1. **Non-Universality**: Quantum gravity effects may not be universal across all GRBs
2. **GRB-Specific Effects**: The effects may depend on specific GRB properties (redshift, duration, energy spectrum)
3. **Detection Threshold**: Current instruments may not be sensitive enough to detect effects in most GRBs
4. **Theoretical Models**: Models predicting universal quantum gravity effects may need revision

## Conclusions

Our analysis of GRB221009A provides no evidence for quantum gravity effects, in stark contrast to the highly significant results obtained for GRB090902B. The weak correlation observed (r = 0.0466, p = 0.2998) is consistent with statistical noise, and the high outlier fraction (50%) suggests that any apparent signal is likely due to systematic effects.

The comparison between GRB090902B and GRB221009A suggests that quantum gravity effects, if real, may be:
- **GRB-specific** rather than universal
- **Dependent on GRB properties** such as redshift, duration, or spectral characteristics
- **Below the detection threshold** for most GRBs with current instruments

This finding highlights the importance of analyzing multiple GRBs to distinguish between genuine quantum gravity effects and GRB-specific astrophysical phenomena. The robust methodology developed here provides a framework for future systematic surveys of GRB data for quantum gravity signatures.
